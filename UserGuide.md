## üèóÔ∏è Core System Architecture

### üìç Coordinate System
The script uses **screen coordinates only** - no game memory modification or value reading. It controls mouse/keyboard input exclusively.

**Setup Process (v1.2.1):**
- Navigate to Other Tools > Coordinate Settings
- List displays all required coordinates with descriptions
- Double-click any coordinate to enter picker mode
- Click corresponding game element
- Coordinate automatically saves to INI file

**Important**: Coordinates vary by screen/game resolution. Default coordinates likely won't work for your setup.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management
- **Auto-saves** every 10 seconds during operation
- **INI Structure**: `[Settings]`, `[FineSettings]`, `[Unlockables]`, `[UnityParameters]`, `[Coordinates]`, `[Sections]`
- **Validation**: Input validation with fallback to defaults
- **Persistence**: All GUI states and parameters saved on exit

## üíé MINERALS & REFINING HELPER

### üéØ Core Concept
Automates the mineral spawn ‚Üí polish ‚Üí merge ‚Üí refine loop to optimize RfT (Refine Tree) point generation. Loop optimization depends heavily on progression stage.

### üîÑ Macro Types & Sequences

**Standard Macro**: `spawn ‚Üí polish ‚Üí long spawn ‚Üí merge ‚Üí refine`
- Balanced approach for general use
- Good default for most progression stages

**Quick Macro**: `spawn ‚Üí polish ‚Üí refine`
- Minimal delays, fastest cycles
- Often optimal based on testing across progression stages
- Best for active monitoring

**Long Macro**: `spawn ‚Üí polish ‚Üí spawn loop ‚Üí merge ‚Üí polish ‚Üí spawn loop ‚Üí merge ‚Üí refine`
- Extended merge cycles for maximum mineral levels
- Higher RfT per cycle but longer duration

### üéØ Game State Presets

Spawn/polish cycles are customizable based on progression. Rule of thumb: earlier progression needs more repetitions.

| State | Spawn Cycles | Polish Cycles | Description |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Early** | 7 | 3 | Multiple spawns needed to reach affordable maximum |
| **Mid** | 5 | 2 | Moderate efficiency |
| **Late** | 4 | 1 | High efficiency, fewer cycles needed |
| **Custom** | User-defined | User-defined | Full customization |

**Spawn Cycle**: Number of highest mineral spawns before polishing. Early game requires multiple spawns to reach maximum affordable level.

**Polish Cycle**: Number of weapon polish rounds before final high-value loop and refining.

**Time Burst Reps** (0-20): Number of Time Burst sequences to execute before refining.
- **0**: Disabled (default) - no Time Burst actions, macros work as before
- **1-20**: Executes the full Time Burst sequence the specified number of times

**Time Burst Sequence**:
1. Set mineral level to highest (999)
2. Navigate to Unity tab ‚Üí activate autospawn (if unlocked)
3. Navigate to Automation tab ‚Üí activate automerge (if unlocked)  
4. Navigate to Time Flux tab ‚Üí perform time warp burst
5. Navigate back to Unity tab ‚Üí deactivate autospawn
6. Navigate back to Automation tab ‚Üí deactivate automerge
7. Return to Unity tab

‚ö†Ô∏è **Requirements**: Time Warp parameters must be configured in Unity Parameters section for Time Burst to work.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Fine Settings Configuration

**Auto Refining** (On/Off):
- **On**: Macro completes full cycle including refining
- **Off**: Stops before refining (useful for VP pushing, Zodiac Value optimization)

**Auto RfT Upgrade** (On/Off):
- **On**: Automatically purchases currently selected RfT Node during long runs
- **Off**: No automatic purchasing
- **Limitation**: Cannot change which upgrade to buy - only purchases selected node

**Weapon Polish Mode**:
- **All Weapons**: Polishes all available weapons
- **Sword Only**: More efficient before auto-polish unlock or Node 23
- **Use Case**: Early game optimization when sword-only is faster

### üîì Automation Unlockables

Script adapts behavior based on your unlocked automations:

**Autospawn**:
- **Disabled**: Script manually clicks spawn buttons during merge loops
- **Enabled**: Script toggles autospawn on/off as needed

**Automerge**:
- **Disabled**: No mineral merging, merge cycles become extended spawn cycles
- **Enabled**: Uses automatic merging system

**Auto Max Level**:
- **Disabled**: Script manually buys "Max Level" upgrade
- **Enabled**: Script skips manual upgrade process
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Once maxLevel coordinates are set, don't move VP upgrade window

**Auto Weapon Polish**:
- **Disabled**: Script clicks each weapon individually
- **Enabled**: Uses game's automatic polishing
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: All weapons must be visible when setting coordinates. May require window scrolling.

### üìä Variables Configuration

**Highest Mineral Level**: 
- Default: 999 (highest unlocked)
- **Early Game**: Highest unlocked = highest affordable
- **Mid/Late Game**: Must manually set to highest *affordable* mineral

**Merge Wait Time**: 
- Millisecond delay during merge loops before merging and polishing
- Default: 5000ms
- **Optimization**: Adjust based on mineral merge speed

**Exploit Wait Time**: 
- Delay for Endgame Exploit timing (see Endgame Exploit section)

### üìä Performance Monitoring

**Game Statistics Section**:
- **Screenshot Capture**: Real-time RfT points display (configurable area)
- **Cycle Count**: Number of completed macro loops
- **Average Cycle Time**: Duration per cycle for RfT/second calculations
- **Configuration**: Edit `captureRect := {x: 1017, y: 386, w: 470, h: 49}` for screenshot area

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Endgame Exploit

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Exploits game bug, potentially game-breaking, use at own risk. May result in bans or save corruption. Developers may patch this.

**Mechanism**: 
Exploits brief timing window when switching mineral levels. When changing from affordable to unaffordable mineral, there's a microsecond window before price updates, allowing purchase of normally unaffordable minerals.

**Implementation**:
Rapidly alternates between highest affordable and highest unlocked mineral levels to repeatedly exploit the timing window.

**Configuration**:
- **Disable Auto Refining**: When farming high-level minerals only
- **Enable Auto Refining**: Integrates exploit into standard polish/refine cycles
- **Exploit Wait Time**: Adjust this based on mineral cost fall, the price of the highest affordable mineral needs to drop to an affordable value before the loops starts again.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### üíæ Installation & Setup

**Q: The script won't start - what's wrong?**
A: Most common issues:
- Make sure you have AutoHotkey v2.0+ installed (not v1.1)
- Right-click the .ahk file ‚Üí "Run Script" if double-clicking doesn't work
- Check Windows Defender/antivirus isn't blocking the script
- Ensure Revolution Idle is running before starting the script

**Q: None of the coordinates work / clicks are missing**
A: This is normal for first-time setup:
- Default coordinates are for specific resolution/setup and likely won't match yours
- Go to "Other Tools > Coordinate Settings" and recalibrate all coordinates
- Make sure Revolution Idle is in windowed mode, not fullscreen
- Try running the game at 1280x720 if possible for better accuracy

**Q: The coordinate picker isn't working**
A: 
- Press Esc first to make sure you're not already in picker mode
- Try closing and reopening the script
- Make sure Revolution Idle window is visible and focused
- Some antivirus software blocks coordinate capture - temporarily disable if needed

### ‚ö° Macro Performance

**Q: Which macro should I use for optimal RfT farming?**
A: Based on testing across progression stages:
- **Quick macro** is often optimal for most situations
- **Standard macro** is good for balanced approach
- **Long macro** only if you need maximum mineral levels per cycle
- Test different macros and compare RfT/second using the statistics section

**Q: My cycles are really slow / the script seems laggy**
A: Increase timing delays:
- Raise "Delay between actions" (MicroDelayMs) to 50-100ms
- Close other resource-intensive programs
- Make sure Revolution Idle window stays focused and visible

**Q: The exploit macro isn't working**
A: The Endgame Exploit requires precise timing:
- Adjust "Exploit wait time" - start with 5000ms (5 seconds) and experiment
- Make sure you can actually afford your "highest mineral level" setting
- Works best when there's a big gap between affordable and max unlocked minerals

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Issues

**Q: My settings keep resetting**
A: Check file permissions:
- Make sure the script folder isn't read-only
- Try running as administrator once to create the INI file
- Check if antivirus is quarantining the configuration file
- Look for `RevolutionIdleHelper_v1.2.ini` in the script directory

**Q: What should I set "Highest mineral level" to?**
A: This depends on your progression:
- **Early game**: Keep at 999 (or your actual max unlocked)
- **Mid/Late game**: Set to the highest mineral you can actually afford to spawn
- **Not** the highest unlocked - the highest you can buy with your current resources
- If unsure, manually spawn minerals in-game to find your affordable maximum

**Q: When should I enable/disable the automation unlockables?**
A: Set based on what you've actually unlocked (and activated) in-game. When in doubt, leave disabled - the script will work manually

### üìö Advanced Usage

**Q: Can I run multiple macros at once?**
A: No, only one macro runs at a time. This is intentional to prevent conflicts and ensure proper sequencing.

**Q: How do I optimize for overnight farming?**
A: Recommended settings:
- Use **Standard** or **Quick** macro
- Enable **Auto Refining**
- Enable **Auto RfT Upgrade** if you want to spend RfT points

**Q: The Time Warp Burst isn't working properly**
A: Check your configuration:
- Make sure you have enough Time Flux for the "Minutes to spend" setting
- "Burst Interval" should be in milliseconds (1000ms = 1 second)
- The script clicks Time Flux tab first - make sure that coordinate is set
- Time Flux spending happens gradually - don't expect instant results

**Q: How do I set up the screenshot capture for RfT tracking?**
A: You need to edit the code:
- Find the line: `static captureRect := {x: 1017, y: 386, w: 470, h: 49}`
- Change x,y to the top-left corner of your RfT display
- Change w,h to the width and height of the area to capture
- Use a screen ruler tool or screenshot to get exact pixel coordinates

### üîç Troubleshooting

**Q: The script suddenly stopped working after a game update**
A: Game updates can change UI layouts:
- Recalibrate all coordinates using the coordinate picker
- Check if any new automation features were added to the game
- Update your automation unlockable settings if needed
- Some coordinates may have shifted slightly

**Q: My antivirus keeps flagging the script**
A: This is common with automation scripts:
- AutoHotkey scripts often trigger false positives
- Add the script folder to your antivirus whitelist
- Download AutoHotkey from official sources only
- The script is open source - you can review the code for safety

**Q: Can this get me banned from Revolution Idle?**
A: The script only uses mouse/keyboard input:
- No memory modification or value injection
- No network communication or data manipulation
- Similar to using a macro keyboard or mouse
- **However**: The Endgame Exploit uses a game bug - use at your own discretion
- Always follow game terms of service and community guidelines
- Do not advertise your use of Tools on he official Discord

**Q: The GUI is too big/small for my screen**
A: The GUI is designed for 1920x1080 but adapts:
- Use **F10** to toggle compact mode for smaller footprint
- Drag the window by clicking and holding the background
- GUI sections can be collapsed to save space
- If severely misaligned, try changing your display scaling

### üöÄ Performance & Optimization

**Q: How can I calculate my optimal RfT per second?**
A: Use the built-in statistics:
- Look at "Average cycle time" in the statistics section
- Manually note your RfT before and after several cycles
- Formula: (RfT gained) / (average cycle time in seconds)
- Test different macros and settings to find your optimum

**Q: Should I use this script for early RfT progression?**
A: It's most beneficial for mid-to-late game:
- Early game benefits less from automation
- Manual play might be faster for initial progression
- Consider starting to use it once manual refining becomes
